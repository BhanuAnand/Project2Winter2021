# Project2Winter2021

In this project, I have created an interactive search interface to scrape and search for information about National Sites (Parks, Heritage Sites, Trails, and other entities) from https://www.nps.gov and then added an ability to also look up for the nearby places using the MapQuest API.

I am also using fcache which is a file-based cache module for Python to avoid hitting the API for the same input
